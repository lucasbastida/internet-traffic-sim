# internet-traffic-sim

* This program must be compiled with c++11.
* The main.cpp file is already linked to the rest of the header files in their respective locations so all that is neded to do is compile main.cpp.
* tinyEWD.txt character encoding is UTF-8 and line encoding is Unix/linux so it might not be displayed properly in a windows os.
  - recommended to run in a linux distribution.
## compilation and execution inside src directory
```
g++ main.cpp -o simulator
./simulator
```
